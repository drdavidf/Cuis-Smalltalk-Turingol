# Introduction

Turingol is a programming language and a development environment for simulating Turing machines. 

The language is an extension of D. Knuth's language of the same name. Knuth has used Turingol in his paper on attribute grammars to illustrate their expressive power. 
I have extended the language with procedures to enable writing larger programs. 

# Insallation

The system is implemented in [Cuis-Smalltalk](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev), therefore you need to install the Smalltalk
virtual machine first. [Install the appropriate VM for your platform](https://github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm/releases). 

Next, download the zip file from the latest release, and unzip it.

# Running

If you are on a Windows or Mac operating system, run the VM you have downloaded earlier. When it asks you to open an image file, give it
the image file in the Turingol folder you have just unzipped. 

If you are on a Linux system, run the VM from the command line and give it the image file as a command line argument.

# Using 

When the window opens click on the background, select `Erudite...`, then `Read...`, and finally `Turingol manual`. 
The manual explains how to write programs, how to run the simulator, and how to see a diagram of the compiled state machine.
